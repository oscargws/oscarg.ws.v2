On a project I'm working on currently we've been using a lot of uncompressed png's, which is killing the pageload of nearly every section.

I didn't want to have to manually compress every file and as a result came up with a little solution using [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/).

First find all the files in the directory you want to compress, so lets use `find` for this.

`find src | grep '.png'`

The output should look something like this.

```
src/components/assets/testing/icon.png
src/components/assets/testing/app.png
```

Now just pipe the output into `xargs` and run `pngquant` on it for each line.

`find src | grep '.png' | xargs -L1 pngquant`

Boom, all the files will now be compressed
